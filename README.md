6. Create a class Student with attributes roll no, name, age and course. Initialize values through parameterized constructor. If age of student is not in between 15 and 21 then generate user defined exception **AgeNotWithinRangeException**. If name contains numbers or special symbols raise exception **NameNotValidException**. Define the two exception classes.
